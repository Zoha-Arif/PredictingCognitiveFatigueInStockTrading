# üß† Predicting Cognitive Fatigue in Stock Trading

This project uses a neural network model to predict cognitive fatigue in simulated stock trading behavior based on decision-making patterns and reaction times. It combines time-series processing, deep learning, and trading simulation to explore how fatigue may manifest in behavioral data.

The goal was to build a real-time fatigue detection system that analyzes:
- Reaction time consistency
- Trading decisions over time (BUY, SELL, HOLD)
- Sequence patterns leading to mental fatigue
